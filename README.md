# ✈️ Aviation Flight Delay Analytics

## Data Analytics and Business Intelligence Portfolio Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes commercial flight delay performance using a professional Business Intelligence workflow. The objective is to identify operational bottlenecks, understand delay behavior, and provide actionable insights for improving airline and airport performance.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics pipeline including data cleaning, SQL star schema modeling, analytical querying, and interactive dashboard visualization in Power BI.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Identify high-delay airports and peak congestion periods  
- Understand weekday and peak-travel delay patterns  
- Analyze the impact of flight distance on delay recovery  
- Highlight operational inefficiencies in ground handling  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for delay reduction

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle (US Commercial Flight Data)  
- Records: ~5,000 flights  
- Key Fields:
  - Flight Date  
  - Airport, City, State  
  - Departure Delay  
  - Arrival Delay  
  - Distance (KM)  
  - Delay Cause Components  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas) – Data Cleaning  
- MySQL – Star Schema Modeling & SQL Analysis  
- Power BI – Dashboard Visualization  
- SQL – Analytical Queries  

---

## 🗂 Data Modeling

A star schema was implemented for analytical efficiency.

### Dimension Tables
- Airports  
- Dates  

### Fact Table
- Flights Fact (delay metrics and distance)

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard was designed with a clean corporate aviation theme and includes:

- KPI Cards  
- Delay Trends  
- Airport Performance Comparison  
- Peak Period Analysis  
- Delay Cause Breakdown  

---

## 🔍 SQL Business Analysis

SQL was used to answer key operational questions:

- Which airport had the highest total delay?  
- Which weekdays experience the highest average delays?  
- Do short-haul flights recover delays less effectively?  
- Which airports perform worst during peak travel days?  

SQL techniques used:
- Aggregations  
- Window Functions  
- Ranking  
- Star Schema Joins

## 🚨 Areas of Improvement

- Ground Operations Inefficiency  
- Peak Travel Capacity Management  
- Schedule Buffer Optimization  
- Post-Landing Taxi and Gate Coordination  

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Improve ground handling workflows  
- Optimize weekend peak-period resource allocation  
- Strengthen schedule buffer management  
- Enhance post-landing turnaround efficiency  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete Business Intelligence lifecycle, from raw data preparation to SQL analysis and dashboard reporting. It highlights that operational congestion and scheduling behavior play a larger role in flight delays than distance alone.
